# car-race-game
simple race game made with unity

Begining
We first appreciate a part of the track and the counters of laps, current time,
best lap, and last lap. All of them are on 0, the game starts when the car crosses the line for the first time.

On use
Once the car crosses the line for the first time the timer starts the only 
thing that the user has to do is drive and void to crash.
